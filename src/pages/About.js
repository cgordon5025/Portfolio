        <p>Thanks for wanting to learn more about me!

            I am a Full Stack Developer, currently enrolled in Georgia Tech's Full Stack Coding BootCamp.

            I started coding in college in the Neurochemistry and Cognition Lab at Brandeis University. Under the direction of Dr. Anne Berry, I created multiple behavioral tasks using PsychoPy, a Python GUI. These tasks were produced the desired memory effect and were subsequently used in our MRI/PET experiments. These tasks were written in Python.
